# The Book of Kells

## Introduction
The purpose of this website is to present my final project for the WATS3020 class, demonstrating my understanding of the history of text in tech. Throughout this page, I will highlight what my selected imagery is, its significance and history, my own adaptation of the selected image, and an analysis of it. After that, I will then discuss the audience my adaptation is intended for and how I would look to persuade that audience with my adaptation. Lastly, I will outline my process and decision making around my adaptation, outlining how I arrived at conclusions that I have. For my image, I am focusing on The **Book of Kells**, specifically the image of Saint Matthew. In my examination, I want to touch on why I have selected this image in particular, how I feel it could be used in the modern era, and what the signifigance of the image is.

## Why This Image?
The Book of Kells is one of the most famous books in the world due to its ornate decorations throughout the book. While there are many images in it that are moving, the image of Saint Matthew is one of the most recognizable and is one that most people who are familiar with the Book of Kells will immediately recall when seeing it. Because of this fact, I felt that it was an image that would lend itself well to being reinterpreted and modernized, allowing for the familiarity to be brought forward and presented in a new manner. The simplicity of the human figure with the complex textures and backgrounds surrounding it make it stand out and it is a stylizing that I believe could be leveraged in advertising quite well. As part of my exercise, I began to think about how a modern company might try to invoke the same familiarity and through that build a trust with the viewer from the start.

## Historical Context
The Book of Kells, which “contains the four Gospels in Latin based on the Vulgate text which St Jerome completed in 384AD, intermixed with readings from the earlier Old Latin translation ("Book Of Kells - The Library Of Trinity College Dublin - Trinity College Dublin").” The Book of Kells is written on a prepared calfskin, called vellum and is heavily decorated with intricate drawings of plants, animals, and humans throughout its 340 folios contained inside. The "exquisite illustrations in the Book of Kells has been a source of inspiration for artists and Irish artisan craftspeople for centuries (Design, 2018)." For my final, I will focus on the primary image from The Book of Matthew.

## The Adaptation

### Cultural Meaning
 Like other early book forms, the Book of Kells, the scribes working on them aimed to create decorations within the book to capture readers attention and as Christopher Jobson describes, "these sketches are like fingerprints or signatures, little clues that reveal a bit about these long forgotten scribes who copied texts but who had no real opportunity to express themselves while working(Jobson)." Where this imagery might not work as well, in viewing it through the **post-structuralism** lens, would be non-Christian parts of the world where familiarity with Christian imagery is not predominant. Referencing early Christian imagery in a part of the world in which Islam is the dominant religion would not carry the same manner of meaning, or could in fact even offend some, potentially.

 ### Formal Qualities ###
 The image adaptation that I've created uses a photo-realistic image in its center with stylized designs surrouding it in a grid pattern. The angles that have been used are sharp in most cases, though there are some rounded corners included on some of the complementary designs used in the margins. The hierarchy of the design puts the focus on the center image, drawing the viewers attention to it before the viewer begins to view outward, tracing the decorations with their eyes. The image does not force the viewer to look in any particular direction, but the eye seems to naturally flow out from the center to the right and then around in a clockwise direction.

## Rhetorical Situation
Because of its recognizability in many parts of the world, this type of an advertisement would resonate with a good size portion of those who use tablets in their daily lives. By calling back to the image of Saint Matthew, viewers see this **representation** and can decipher that this is an ad for tablets while at the same time they are reminded of imagery they have seen before, giving this a familiary feeling or sentiment for them. As Roland Barthes identified, the imageery has two levels of meaning, **denotative** and **connotative**. The denotative meaning for this imagery captures the "documentary evidence of objective circumstances (Sturken & Cartwright, 19)," or plainly, viewers are able to see the tablets and know that the image seen is a tablet. The connotative meaning is where the "cultural and historical context of the image and its viewers lived, felt knowledge of those circumstances - all that the image means to them personally and socially (Sturken 7 Cartwright, 19)." Building on this, those who have had exposure to Christian imagery will potentially find familiarity with the adaptation I've made and from there their social understanding of how tablets are used in our societies can mesh together with their religious cultural understandings to unite the image in their minds. How might someone like Pierre Bourdieu see an image like this? Bourdieu would likely point to the habitus, or socialized norms, around the tablet imagery. Our society is familiar with their presence and role they play, and the habitus is "created through a social, rather than individual process leading to patterns that are enduring and transferrable from one context to another, but that also shift in relation to specific contexts and over time ("Bourdieu And 'Habitus' | Understanding Power For Social Change | Powercube.Net | IDS At Sussex University")." Because we are socially conditioned to recognize the tablet, it is an ideal image to play with in new representations such as this.

## Reflection
In examining my adaptation, I think that my intended audience would identify, even subconciously, the imagery at play here. Through this, the intent to capture their attention, and if it were to be branded with something like the Apple logo, their trust as an advertisement they would want to view. If I had abundant time and resources, I would definitely make the outer elements more intricate to reflect the original image more. Additionally, I would have the model dress in a more stylized manner and use imagery on the tablets that help to echo the sentiment that this is a brand that can be trusted. If I worked in marketing or advertising, I would look to build off this idea in a more meaningful manner to perhaps create an entire ad campaign around the Book of Kells and other imagery throughout it.
