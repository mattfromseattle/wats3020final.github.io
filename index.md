# The Book of Kells

## Introduction
The purpose of this website is to present my final project for the WATS3020 class, demonstrating my understanding of the history of text in tech. Throughout this page, I will highlight what my selected imagery is, its significance and history, my own adaptation of the selected image, and an analysis of it. After that, I will then discuss the audience my adaptation is intended for and how I would look to persuade that audience with my adaptation. Lastly, I will outline my process and decision making around my adaptation, outlining how I arrived at conclusions that I have. For my image, I am focusing on The **Book of Kells**, specifically the image of Saint Matthew. In my examination, I want to touch on why I have selected this image in particular, how I feel it could be used in the modern era, and what the signifigance of the image is.

## Why This Image?
The Book of Kells is one of the most famous books in the world due to its ornate decorations throughout the book. While there are many images in it that are moving, the image of Saint Matthew is one of the most recognizable and is one that most people who are familiar with the Book of Kells will immediately recall when seeing it. Because of this fact, I felt that it was an image that would lend itself well to being reinterpreted and modernized, allowing for the familiarity to be brought forward and presented in a new manner. The simplicity of the human figure with the complex textures and backgrounds surrounding it make it stand out and it is a stylizing that I believe could be leveraged in advertising quite well. As part of my exercise, I began to think about how a modern company might try to invoke the same familiarity and through that build a trust with the viewer from the start.

## Historical Context
The Book of Kells, which “contains the four Gospels in Latin based on the Vulgate text which St Jerome completed in 384AD, intermixed with readings from the earlier Old Latin translation ("Book Of Kells - The Library Of Trinity College Dublin - Trinity College Dublin").” The Book of Kells is written on a prepared calfskin, called vellum and is heavily decorated with intricate drawings of plants, animals, and humans throughout its 340 folios contained inside. The "exquisite illustrations in the Book of Kells has been a source of inspiration for artists and Irish artisan craftspeople for centuries (Design, 2018)." For my final, I will focus on the primary image from The Book of Matthew.
